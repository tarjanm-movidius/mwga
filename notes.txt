*** Having the most basic utils available in your PATH:

Create a directory C:\xbin (that will be our playground)
Add to PATH in Advanced System Settings -> Environment variables

Install git for windows
Copy git bash binaries:
- create list of exe files, run them as commands (w/o .exe) and copy those which are 'command not found'
- create list of copied exe files, cygcheck them. copy dlls as needed
- add %HOME% to user's env vars
- setx /M MAGIC c:\xbin\share\magic.mgc (also copy MIME magic file there)
- create \tmp - can't manage rights :/


*** Means to open old .hlp files:

winhlp32:
- download w8.1 winhlp32.exe and copy to path (C:\xbin)
- search registry for winhlp32 and alter as needed


*** netcat, nmap

nmap!


*** To disable compattelrunner.exe and similar telemetry, just do:

Task Scheduler - Microsoft - Windows:
 - Application Experience - right click on each task: DISABLE
 - Customer Experience Improvement Program - right click on each task: DISABLE
 - Device Information - right click on each task: DISABLE


### Puto Windows 11 ###


*** MS Teams

- Disable animations
- Disable GPU hardware acceleration, because - that's right kids - it hogs the CPU


*** TextInputHost, thanks for the keylogger but no thanks

*** Disable puto services in registry

Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DoSvc
key Start -> 4


*** Auto level control on the headphone output,

...that makes music sound like what you recorded off the TV with your cassette recorder's microphone in 1993
Device Manager -> Sound and whatnot -> Realtek Audio -> Update Driver -> Select manually off HDD -> Microsoft -> High Definition Audio (generic, whichever is the least outdated)
Task Manager -> Startup -> disable Realtek everything, then pray to Bill Gates that maybe after the NEXT reboot you won't have to do it all over AGAIN


*** Controlling unwanted apps and services

This only works as a continuously running service, task scheduler every 5min (and then running in like 5 instances after a few days) doesn't cut it.
After bootup, start cmd.exe as admin, run killemall.bat. It starts killemall.sh that reads kill.lst and checks every 5 seconds for tasks in it to kill.
